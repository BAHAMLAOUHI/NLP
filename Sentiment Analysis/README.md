we will explore the steps of Sentiment analysis (sentence level) which is
a typical supervised learning task where given a text string, it categorizes the text string into
predefined categories.
 Given a course review, your task is to predict the sentiment (or opinion) about the
considered course.

 To solve this problem:

1. import the required libraries and the dataset.
   
2. perform text pre-processing (data cleaning).
   
3. extract features using Bag of words model
   
4. use logistic regression estimator and evaluate its accuracy on the test set
